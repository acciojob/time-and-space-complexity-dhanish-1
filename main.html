	 <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, relative to the size of its input. It helps us determine whether an algorithm is efficient enough to handle large inputs and perform well in practical scenarios.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory or storage an algorithm uses while it is running. The space required by an algorithm can vary, but in many cases, the space complexity is proportional to the size of the input, often represented as O(n), where n is the size of the input data.</p>
